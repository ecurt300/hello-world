# Little bit about myself.
Hello, my name is Edward James(E.J.) Curtis, I am currently a hobbyist game programmer looking to enter the game industry(indie)
I specialize - know how to use the following:

Game Engines:
Unity
Godot
Monogame(Microsoft XNA)

3D Modeling Software:
Blender

Know how and some of the basics on several programming languages:

C#
Java
Python
C++
C

I have participated within game jams locally and globally completing some very basic projects in unity solo and with other people(friends).

I would love to get better at finishing projects.

I have several hobbies: PC Gaming, hobbyist gamedev. I have some interests outside of tech as well. I just recently have become interested in contra dancing which is a type of bluegrass folk dance. I like to go on walks, and exercise. 
Drawing has been an interest of mine longer than computers.

Some of my other interests:
Listening to a wide variety of music
Keeping up on the latest scientific advances.
Hanging out with friends
